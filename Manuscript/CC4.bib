@article{Veril_2021,
	abstract = {Abstract We describe our efforts of the past few years to create a large set of more than 500 highly accurate vertical excitation energies of various natures (π → π*, n → π*, double excitation, Rydberg, singlet, doublet, triplet, etc.) in small- and medium-sized molecules. These values have been obtained using an incremental strategy which consists in combining high-order coupled cluster and selected configuration interaction calculations using increasingly large diffuse basis sets in order to reach high accuracy. One of the key aspects of the so-called QUEST database of vertical excitations is that it does not rely on any experimental values, avoiding potential biases inherently linked to experiments and facilitating theoretical cross comparisons. Following this composite protocol, we have been able to produce theoretical best estimates (TBEs) with the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set for each of these transitions, as well as basis set corrected TBEs (i.e., near the complete basis set limit) for some of them. The TBEs/aug-cc-pVTZ have been employed to benchmark a large number of (lower-order) wave function methods such as CIS(D), ADC(2), CC2, STEOM-CCSD, CCSD, CCSDR(3), CCSDT-3, ADC(3), CC3, NEVPT2, and so on (including spin-scaled variants). In order to gather the huge amount of data produced during the QUEST project, we have created a website (https://lcpq.github.io/QUESTDB\_website) where one can easily test and compare the accuracy of a given method with respect to various variables such as the molecule size or its family, the nature of the excited states, the type of basis set, and so on. We hope that the present review will provide a useful summary of our effort so far and foster new developments around excited-state methods.

@article{Christiansen_1998,
	abstract = {Abstract It is demonstrated that frequency-dependent response functions can conveniently be derived from the time-averaged quasienergy. The variational criteria for the quasienergy determines the time-evolution of the wave-function parameters and the time-averaged time-dependent Hellmann--Feynman theorem allows an identification of response functions as derivatives of the quasienergy. The quasienergy therefore plays the same role as the usual energy in time-independent theory, and the same techniques can be used to obtain computationally tractable expressions for response properties, as for energy derivatives in time-independent theory. This includes the use of the variational Lagrangian technique for obtaining expressions for molecular properties in accord with the 2n+1 and 2n+2 rules. The derivation of frequency-dependent response properties becomes a simple extension of variational perturbation theory to a Fourier component variational perturbation theory. The generality and simplicity of this approach are illustrated by derivation of linear and higher-order response functions for both exact and approximate wave functions and for both variational and nonvariational wave functions. Examples of approximate models discussed in this article are coupled-cluster, self-consistent field, and second-order M{\o}ller--Plesset perturbation theory. A discussion of symmetry properties of the response functions and their relation to molecular properties is also given, with special attention to the calculation of transition- and excited-state properties. {\copyright} 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.
